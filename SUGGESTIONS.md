# Suggestions

### Project
Good work !!!

### README
- Really messy readme file, what leaved somewhat bad taste.
- CLEAN THE README.md file

### SCRIPTS
- Functions should start with `function` key word
- there is not validation that script is running is running on debian based system
- in some scripts there `set -x`, i am guessing by mistake, it leaves messy output
